# LinearAlgebraPython
## By Gabriel Konar-Steenberg
This is an attempt to write out in Python some linear algebra algorithms and properties, mostly for my own educational benefit. Though there is a lot still to do, the project is currently dormant as I have other things to work on.

Because the goal is educational benefit, techical correctness (as measured against the textbook definition) is a high priority and optimization for practical use is not. I use the built-in Python libraries and Python's native complex number support, but no external libraries such as NumPy because the point is to implement those things myself.

My linear algebra textbooks have been:
 * Bretscher, Otto (2013). "Linear Algebra with Applications (Fifth Edition)."
 * Garcia, Stephan Ramon and Horn, Roger A. (2017). "A Second Course in Linear Algebra."
